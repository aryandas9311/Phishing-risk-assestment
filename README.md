Phishing Risk Management System (Python, GRC/SOC focus): Developed a rule-based phishing detection and risk management system that analyzes URLs, calculates risk scores (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH), and generates SOC-style alerts. Each alert includes detailed justification for GRC compliance. Built a risk register mapping Threat → Impact → Likelihood → Risk → Controls, demonstrating integration of security operations with governance frameworks.
